# Bank-management-system coded in Java
This Java project was developed in the course "Programming 2" of "Business Computer Science " from the "HTW Berlin- University of Applied Science", in the advanced Java programming course. 
The Java project (Bank-management-system) was created by a term paper, wich we had to programm on our own. We got from our professor, who represented the bank almost every week, a new catalog
of requirements, wich we had to implement.
The data structures that were to be used were exactly specified.
However, we were not provided with a single line of code for this project.

What does this Java project contain?

- Package structures for a clear seperation of the code responsibilities
- Diffrent classes in the packages
- Objects from diffrent classes
- Diffrent data structures like ArrayLists, HashMaps and there diffrent methods for manipulating datas from the library
- Enums
- Methods without return values, methods with return value and abstract methods
- Diffrent loops
- Regular expressions
- Inheritance
- Interfaces
- Compare objects with interfaces comparable and comparator
- Java Design Patterns like singleton, observer, strategy
- Streams like fileInputStreams and fileOutputStreams
- Threads
- GUI with swing
- A menu in the console
- JUnit testing
